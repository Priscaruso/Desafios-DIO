# Desafios-DIO
Python exercises from the Data Engineer Bootcamp.

Desafio1_DIO.py : 
An exercise that asks to create a code to convert numerical grades (0 to 100) into letter grades (A,B,C,D and E).
You enter a numerical input value and the output should be a letter value.
For this conversion, it's used the table below:

| Numerical grade | Letter grade |
|:---------------:|:------------:|
|       0         |       E      |
|    1 to 35      |       D      |
|    36 to 60     |       C      |
|    61 to 85     |       B      |
|    86 to 100    |       A      |

Desafio2_DIO.py : A task that wants you to write a code that shows the first ten values of a vector in the format N[i] = x. The first value of x is equal to the first integer input value that the user types and the next values of x will be equal to the double of the previous ones.
