# Desafios-DIO
Python exercises from the Data Engineer Bootcamp.

Desafio1_DIO.py : 
An exercise that asks to create a code to convert numerical grades (0 to 100) into letter grades (A,B,C,D and E).
You enter a numerical input value and the output should be a letter value.
For this conversion, it's used the table below:

| Numerical grade | Letter grade |
|:---------------:|:------------:|
|       0         |       E      |
|    1 to 35      |       D      |
|    36 to 60     |       C      |
|    61 to 85     |       B      |
|    86 to 100    |       A      |

Desafio2_DIO.py : A task that wants you to write a code that shows the first ten values of a vector in the format N[i] = x. The first value of x is equal to the first integer input value that the user types and the next values of x will be equal to the double of the previous ones. 


Desafio3_DIO.py: An exercise that requests you to create a code that prints the value of the triangle perimeter if you enter 3 input values that 
attend the condition for being a triangle. If these values don't attend the triangle condition, then the output will be the value of the trapezium area.
The triangle perimeter is the sum of the triangle sizes. The trapezium area is calculed by the formula below:

[(B+b).h]/2 , where B is the first, b is the second and h is the third input value. 


Desafio_numero_impar.py : A challenge that asks the user to enter a positive integer value (x) and displays the odd numbers from 1 to x, including x if is the case.

desafio_numeros_pares.py: A challenge thats asks the user to enter a positive integer value (x) and shows the even numbers from 0 to x, including x if is the case.

Desafio_folha_de_pagamento.py: A task that wants you to create a code that shows the number of the employee and its corresponding salary. The user enters the number of the employee, the worked hours and how much it receives per worked hour.

Desafio_validação_de_notas.py: A task that requests you to write a code to validate the student's grades. The user enters the first and the second student's grade that must be from 0 to 10. If the grade doesn't meet this requirement, the user will be prompted to enter a validate grade again. The code calculates and shows the student average grade and asks if the user wants to make a new calculus by typing the option '1' or not by typing '2'. 

desafio_fibonacci_facil: A challenge that asks you to create a code to exihibit the fibonacci sequence. The user enters the number of elements it wants to see from the sequence.
